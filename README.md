# Shithead

A card game I learnt a long time ago. This gem encapsulates a lot of the game logic, and plays games automatically for you with very basic AI. There's not yet a way to play the games yourself in an interactive fashion.

## Installation

    $ gem install shithead

## Usage

Use the command-line tool to see a game played between as many opponents as you care to name. If you have 4 opponents, two decks will be combined (else the games are a little short!).

    $ shithead Clarke Dawe
